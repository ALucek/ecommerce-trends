    "Virtual try-on is a technology that allows people to see how clothing or accessories might look on them without physically wearing the items. It uses image generation (diffusion) models to align and adjust the garment images to fit the person's body shape and pose. We have seen examples using Augmented Reality, however this allows a much more realistic generation.\n",
